Hi guys I am Kasper From Hackers Assemble

Welcome to shell and cpanel cracking course and this course is free for
our subscribers.

	Grabbing domains#2
	
so now we going to use another way to get domains or site lists 

we will use a website called publicwww.com

Open this in your browser and follow me

Now this is a source code search engine means we can have our keywords and target wordpress sites

Think what common words a wordpress website source code would contain

example: wp-content;wp-content/themes;wp-uploads or whatever it is

So lets search for our domains

We have our results and you see those numbers 50000 domains those all are accessible only to premium users of the site
but free one is also good for us we can get good amount with that as well if you want to purchase premium purchase on your own 
risk. do lets download the URLs now you can use different keywords and countries to get different results just like dorks.

you can also specify a theme which is commanly used or this method can also be used to grab laravel list
	so after downloading lets filter the URLS to domains
	so we got 1k domains from it so for now byee I will see you in the next one
