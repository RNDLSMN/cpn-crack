Hi guys I am Kasper From Hackers Assemble

Welcome to shell and cpanel cracking course and this course is free for
our subscribers.

So as you saw in the previous video I had got one login but that was not good so you remember I made a short
site list of about 3.5k domains so I used it and I got another wordpress login 

I already logged it in so lets proceed with the shell installation part so follow me

First we need to install advanced file manager plugin

after install we need to activate it

Now go to the file manager and then we will upload our shell in there and you can rename it or put in some
directory so that it remains hidden from the admins

there we go now we have a shell

so Now we can have access to the cpanel of this website and its done by a misconfiguration in the settings
that the contactemail file is editable in the cpanel so if you have a shell you can browse and edit the
contactemail to your email or temp mail and then reset the password and you can get the username very easily
if there is any you would see it after the /home directory so its easy but to make it simple wso shell
can auto do it for you but your shell should have cpanel in my case I was not lucky enough because I had 
a short list you need big list and spend time to collect that I got only 1 login within 3.5k its not always
about the quantity some times if you use good sources and keywords you will get good and hq list and get 
even 10 or 50 wordpress logins cracked so think of good keywords and never share them unless you dont want
to use them create private dorks I might discuss about getting much big list with less effort and auto mated
and thats not a method you need skill for that aswell unless you dont have skills to do your tasks your 
own way you will be slow.

so yeah lets see how we can get cpanel and webmail smtp as well and rdp only if your website is running on
windows hosted server in the zone-h you can see the OS of the hosting so you can target and filter windows
hosted systems in zone-h and grab that sites to hack the rdp or the server for proffessional term rdp is 
just a protocol

the Cpanel/WHM crack method is not that useful in the shell cpanel pass reset is efficient and crack is hard
and not always or great success lol you can also get a reverse netcat session with this 

we have more sites on this server so you can also go through that data if you like

So yeah thats it for today Cpanel reset is really simple if you dont want to do it from wso I have a 
seperate shell for CPanel and I have shared it in the shells folder

I hope you have learned some stuff this is the final video Byee and lets get to 4k subs and then 5k and go on
I am back now..
